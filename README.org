* Security
- don't parse the header for the JWT for encryption settings
- use a preshared key for this simple use case
- for more security we can rotate the keys and store them in vault
* Build & Run
* Architecture
** Tag v1.0
*** Rails Web
    - devise login
    - html served
    - synchronous
*** Greeting API
   - grpc go greeting certificate auth
   - (I could also just use a JSON Api)
*** Deployment
* Security
** v1 Shared Secret
*** Mitigation
Rotate shared secret, and distributed with vault
** Pub Key
- Either there is a pub key store somewhere
- Or apps are deployed with each others pub keys - this is an issue
